# Template reporting workflows

*Simple ways from modeling results to standardized outputs*

This repository provides a number of template workflows and illustrative examples to 
automate the processing of modeling results to the standardized MS Excel results template
used by the [Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC)](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/iamc/). 
Our aim is to provide best-practice code snippets for output data processing to the modeling community, 
so that we can spend more energy on developing models and analyzing the results, while requiring less time and 
effort for the post-processing.

##Contents:

- Dantzig’s transportation example (in GAMS) using R
- The economy-energy model ETAMAC (in GAMS) using R  
- The gdx2iamc R package is the most advanced GAMS-gdx-to-Excel code using R in this repository (to date)

##How to use this repository and the templates

- Search for a template that matches the programming languages and workflows of your own model
- Download and study the template(s), and implement them in your model to make your output processing more efficient
- Contact the person(s) who contributed to that particular template workflow for additional explanation, if necessary
- Please contribute to this repository if you have new or improved workflow examples
